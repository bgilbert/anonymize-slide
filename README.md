anonymize-slide
===============

This is a program to remove the slide label from whole-slide images in the
following formats:

 * Aperio SVS
 * Hamamatsu NDPI
 * 3DHISTECH MRXS

Slide files are modified **in place**, making this program both fast and
potentially destructive.  Do not run it on your only copy of a slide.

    anonymize-slide.py slide.mrxs

Delete the label from all NDPI files in the current directory:

    anonymize-slide.py *.ndpi
